# headcore

Inspect Sitecore Experience Edge route layout data and scaffold typed,
Content SDK-ready Next.js components from it.

## Two ways to work

- **Library** — add pre-built, copy-in components you own and edit:

  ```sh
  headcore list             # see available components
  headcore info <Name>      # component details + how to model its Sitecore side
  headcore add <Name>       # copy the component into your project + write SITECORE.md
  ```

- **Introspect** — generate code from a live Sitecore/Experience Edge instance
  (see Commands below).

## Install

```sh
npm install -g headcore
# or run without installing:
npx headcore inspect <route>
```

## Setup

1. Copy `headcore.config.example.ts` to `headcore.config.ts`.
2. Configure auth (env vars are read from `.env.local`/`.env` next to the
   config file automatically; shell env takes precedence):
   - **XM Cloud (Content SDK):** set `SITECORE_EDGE_CONTEXT_ID` and use
     `edge.contextId`. The tool talks to
     `https://edge-platform.sitecorecloud.io/v1/content/api/graphql/v1`.
   - **Legacy Experience Edge:** set `SITECORE_EDGE_URL` and
     `SITECORE_EDGE_TOKEN` and use `edge.endpoint` + `edge.apiKey`.
   Exactly one auth mode must be configured.
3. Set `edge.site` and `edge.defaultLanguage` in the config.

## Commands

```sh
headcore inspect <route>
headcore page <route> [--lang <lang>] [--dry-run] [--force]
headcore dictionary [--lang <lang>] [--dry-run] [--force]
headcore component <Name> --route <route> [--lang <lang>] [--variants <A,B,C>] [--dry-run] [--force]
```

- `inspect` prints the rendering/placeholder tree for a route.
- `component` scaffolds `<Name>.tsx`, `<Name>.types.ts`, `<Name>.mock.json`, and
  (when `styling: 'css'`) `<Name>.module.css`.
- `page` scaffolds **every** component on a route in one pass, deduping component
  types and merging inferred field shapes across all instances.
- `dictionary` fetches the site dictionary from Experience Edge and generates
  type-safe translations (`dictionary-keys.ts` + a `useTypedT()` hook).

See the [project README](https://github.com/BieganskiP/headcore#readme)
for full documentation on styling, placeholders, rendering variants, and type
inference.
